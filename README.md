# Optimal Cricket XI Selection Model

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Java program to analyze and present the best 11 players from competing cricket teams based on their performance metrics. It utilizes a point-based selection algorithm to dynamically determine the best team composition, ensuring optimal player selection for the "Best 11" cricket model.

## Key Features
- Developed a Java program to analyze and present the best 11 players from competing cricket teams.
- Implemented a heterogeneous array structure to efficiently store and manage data representing player statistics and match performance.
- Utilized a point-based selection algorithm to dynamically determine the best team composition.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
2. Compile and run the Java program:
